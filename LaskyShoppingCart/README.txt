      Front End:

2.) How the persistent layer could be implemented?
      The persistent layer for this project is partially implemented already.
      It is using The Repository Layer of the Application Microservice Server
      The remaining part is just the Database Layer which can be implemented using HikariCP
         and MySQL or Postgres SQL or any supported SQL Server.
         It will be using DB Pooling connection scheme.
